		<h2 style="font-family:comic sans ms;"> My goals</h2>
		<p>My life goals focus mainly on my family and fiends. 
		I want to be successful in my community by becoming a member of politics. 
		This was I can effect people on a much more personal <br>
		level and be a positive influence in my community. 
		I aspire to be a business major and work for a company that I can one day run and make it as successful as possible. 
		I hope to have a <br> chance to travel the world and meet all different types of people. 
		It is my goal to retire with knowing that I have done the best with what jobs and people interactions 
		I have dealt with years before. </p>
		<h2 style="font-family:comic sans ms;"> A year in review</h2>
		<p>This year I completed my senior year of high school at Parkland High School in my hometown<br>
		of Allentown Pennsylvania. I was the senior vice president of my class and played lacrosse, track and field<br>
		,cross country, and basketball. After I graduated I took a vacation to Punta Cana with family and friends<br>
		and had a blast. Then I reported for R-Day and learned and spent the summer developing discipline, military bearing, and mental toughness.</p>
